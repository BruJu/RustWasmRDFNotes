Solution : Actually compile in release mode.

For every test with PRIWA we use Datasetcorearry as the used dataset

FastDS takes 20 sec to load

But the catch is that the FastDataset is useless for querying PO (the tested
match). The indexing is only used if we only query an object. n3js is
optimized for PO and not P / O.


| Name                     | P    | O    | PO   |
| ------------------------ | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| n3js                     | 0.26 | 0.26 | 0.07 |
| priwa array              | 0.33 | 0.24 | 0.29 |
| priwa fastDS into array  | 0.26 | 0.12 | 0.30 |
| Graphy                   | 0.30 | 0.32 | 0.36 |
| priwa fastdataset x2     | 0.69 | 0.53 | 0.72 |


n3js is way faster for PO because it uses an alternative indexes if there are
more than 1 keys.






Using unchecked imports : - 4 sec on fastds (from 20 to 16 sec for loading)
